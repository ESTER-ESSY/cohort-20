          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>Software design is the process of making high-level plans for the software. Design is sometimes divided into levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Interface design plans the interaction between a system and its environment as well as the inner workings of the system</li>
            <li>	Architectural design plans the major components of a system; including their responsibilities, properties, and interfaces between them.</li>
            <li>	Detailed design plans internal elements; including their properties, relationships, algorithms and data structures</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Construction</h2>
            <p>Software construction, typically involves programming (a.k.a. coding), unit testing, integration testing, and debugging so as to implement the design. “Software testing is related to, but different from, ... debugging”. Testing during this phase is generally performed by the programmer and with the purpose to verify that the code behaves per design and to know when the code is ready for next level testing</p>
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>Software testing is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software under test</p>
          <p>When described separately from construction, testing typically is performed by test engineers or quality assurance instead of the programmers who wrote it and is performed at the system level and is considered an aspect of software quality</p>

            <h2>Program analysis</h2>
            <p>Program analysis is the process of analyzing computer programs with respect to an aspect such as performance, robustness, and security.</p>
